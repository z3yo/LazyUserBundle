LazyUserBundle
======

The LazyUserBundle adds support for a database-backed user system in Symfony2.
It provides a flexible system for user management which carries out 
common tasks such as user registration and password retrieval.

Features include:

- Users can be stored only via Doctrine ORM
- Registration support, with an optional confirmation per mail
- Password reset support
- //Unit tested

**Note:** This bundle does *not* use the Symfony2 [SecurityBundle](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html). authentication system.
